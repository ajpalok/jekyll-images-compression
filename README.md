# jekyll-compress-images

Plugin for compress/optimize images (jpg, png, gif, svg).

```

and in `_config.yml`:

```ruby
plugins:
  - jekyll-compress-images
```

Run `bundle install` in your project folder

# Configuration

If you want to setup different path for images, open `_config.yml` add

```ruby
compress_images:
  images_path: "yourpath/img/**/*.{gif,png,jpg,jpeg}"
```

if you don't configure your default path will be `assets/img/**/*.{gif,png,jpg,jpeg}`
